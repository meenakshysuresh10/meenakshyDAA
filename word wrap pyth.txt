8.  Given an array of strings words and a width maxWidth, format the text such that each line has exactly maxWidth characters and is fully (left and right) justified.
You should pack your words in a greedy approach; that is, pack as many words as you can in each line. Pad extra spaces ' ' when necessary so that each line has exactly maxWidth characters.
Extra spaces between words should be distributed as evenly as possible. If the number of spaces on a line does not divide evenly between words, the empty slots on the left will be assigned more spaces than the slots on the right.
For the last line of text, it should be left-justified, and no extra space is inserted between words.Example 1:
Input: words = ["This", "is", "an", "example", "of", "text", "justification."], maxWidth = 16
Output:
[   "This    is    an",
   "example  of text",
   "justification.  "
]


def fullJustify(words,maxWidth):
    def justify_line(line,width,is_last_line):
        if is_last_line:
            return ' '.join(line).ljust(width)
        if len(line)==1:
            return line[0].ljust(width)
        total_spaces=width-sum(len(word) for word in line)
        spaces_between_words=len(line)-1
        min_spaces=total_spaces//spaces_between_words
        extra_spaces=total_spaces%spaces_between_words
        result=''
        for i in range(spaces_between_words):
            result+=line[i]+' '*(min_spaces+(1 if i < extra_spaces else 0))
        result+=line[-1]
        return result 
    result, line, num_of_letters=[],[],0
    for word in words:
        if num_of_letters+len(word)+len(line)>maxWidth:
            result.append(justify_line(line,maxWidth,False))
            line, num_of_letters=[],0
        line.append(word)
        num_of_letters+=len(word)
    result.append(justify_line(line, maxWidth, True))
    return result
words = ["This","is","an","example","of","text","justification."]
maxWidth=16
justified_text=fullJustify(words, maxWidth)
for line in justified_text:
    print(f'"{line}"')
output:

"This    is    an"
"example  of text"
"justification.  "
