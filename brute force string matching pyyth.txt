7.  Given two strings needle and haystack, return the index of the first occurrence of needle in haystack, or -1 if needle is not part of haystack.
Example 1:
Input: haystack = "sadbutsad", needle = "sad"
Output: 0
Explanation: "sad" occurs at index 0 and 6.


def bruteforce(text,pattern):
    n=len(text)
    m=len(pattern)
    found=False
    for i in range(n-m+1):
        j=0
        while j<m and pattern[j]==text[i+j]:
            j+=1
        if j==m:
            print(f"pattern is found at index:{i}")
            found=True
    if not found:
        print("pattern not found")
text="sadbutsad"
pattern="sad"
bruteforce(text,pattern)

output:
pattern is found at index :0
pattern is found at index :6
